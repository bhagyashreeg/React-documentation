# Extend component

* The component allows us to pass props to a userdefined class,when it is not present like in App class.
* We can also say functions like setState in component which will then be inherited into any class that extends the component.
* Extend is nothing but a inheritance.
* It is like, when a child class derives properties from its parent class, we call inheritance.
